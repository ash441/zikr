Whenever any relative would come to him in difficult time asking for money or any other thing, he used to help them without any argument. I remember it well that once some relative came to him and asked for money he needed in buying some piece of land. Hazrat himself did not have any money at that time but he told him to come after two days. After two days he gave him money after having borrowed it from a friend of his."

Her mother had not married after her husband’s death rather involved herself in her children’s upbringing until all of her daughters were married. The widow had no male child. Therefore, with her approval her brothers got her married. At this wedding, her married daughter cried a lot and became very grieved saying that our mother will now forget us while our father has already died. When this news reached Hazrat, he called the girl and through his family conveyed the message that she need not worry and that she should take him as her father and his home as her own. On the very same day he gave her flour, wheat and probably money as well. He would always take care of her and help her."

Every day after the Asr prayer he would walk from Qazi Ahmed More to Government College just for entertainment and during that he would sit down on the footpath near Government College for some time.When he would get up to leave, he used to ask him if there was any ant on his clothes. If there would have been any, Hazrat used to shake it off there and then before leaving. If any ant was to be seen after having traveled some distance, Hazrat would bring it back to the same place. We can estimate his love and kindness for small creatures through this incident. This act of him reminds us of Hazrat Abul Hasan Kharqani. We are told that once Sheikh Kharqani bought some wheat from a village. When he came back and lowered the sack from his head he saw an ant moving in it. Sheikh got extremely worried, heaved the sack over his head again and went back to the village from which he had bought it. He lowered the sack on reaching the village and opened it.The ant got out of it and moved away on the floor. Now Sheikh tied the sack and went back again to his house."

The virtuous and saintly character, humane and affectionate behavior, very kind attitude, piousness, piety and immense following of the Shari’ah by Hazrat Sohna Sa’een was so great that the people around him would become astounded and speechless. It is said that whenever he walked from his home to the mosque, he covered his head entirely with a cloth (which we were to see afterwards for all his life) and keeping his eyes downcast he passed as if an angel clothed in white dress engrossed in the dhikr is filling the heart with elation. This great character of him had got him a high place in the hearts of not only Muslims but also the non-Muslims. When Hazrat Sohna Saen intended to migrate from Khanwahan to Dinpur, all the Muslims of his area requested him not to leave them. This was the condition of the love of the Muslims for him while the hindus came over to his home with a cloth around their necks and apologized. They asked him if there had been any mistake from their side which had made him to leave the town and begged him to stay there and not to orphan them. "
