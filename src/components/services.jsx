                 "In the part about mysticism and spirituality, the qualities of a perfect Sheikh were discussed generally. Here, the signs of a Murshid-e-Kamil"
                 : "shall be described in detail so that unaware people are not fooled by some fake person with the titles of Murshid or Sheikh bringing them loss instead of any advantage. Speaking on this important subject, a noted sheikh of Tariqa Aalia Naqshbandia, Hazrat Haji Dost Muhammad Qandhari states in one of his letters, The first sign of a perfect Wali is that he is absolutely Sunni (following the Sunnah) in his beliefs. In other words, the sign of a Wali is that he has firm beliefs exactly like those of Ahle Sunnah wal Jamaat. Hazrat Mujaddid Alf Sani (RA) also mentioned in his letter to Khawaja Jamal-ud-Din Hussain the beliefs of Ahle Sunnah at the top of the beloved tasks of Almighty Allah. He wrote Ensure first that your beliefs are exactly as those of Ahle Sunnah wal Jamaat. Secondly, act according to the teachings of the Shariah and the Islamic Jurisprudence. Third, act according to the way of Sufiya-e- Karam. Whoever was able to accomplish all of these tasks earned great success and whoever was deprived remained in great deficit. (Letter 177, Copy 1, Part 3) Haji Dost Muhammad Qandhari in further explanation of the third point states, Following are the ten points given by Sufiya-e-Karam: Repentance i.e. returning to Allah for forgiveness; Piety i.e. no inclination towards the world; Piousness; Patience and Gratitude; Trust on Allah; Acceptance and Pleasure gained generally or in detail; also his company should have so much an impact that whoever associates with him loses love for the world and its residents, and all the negligence from the hearts of the associates is driven away; this person considers himself inferior than everyone; never praises himself and is adorned with the qualities like hospitality, knowledge, tolerance and understanding, benevolence and generosity, cheerfulness, unctuousness, verity, humility and meekness; stays away from hurting others as far as possible; abstains from illegal, doubtful and abominable thing;, in short, he is adorned with all the good deeds and his character is similar to that of the Prophet (peace be upon him). The company of such a person is a great blessing and a great treasure. (Letter 19)"

                 : "commandments. It is necessary because the real place of a Murshid is to command and bring those things into practice that the Shariah commands, for instance, he should command prayers, fasting, patience and gratitude, contentment, trust on Allah and piety and stop them from those tasks that are disallowed like lying, backbiting and stealing, it will be possible only in case when he himself is aware of these commandments. Conversely, “one who himself اْدُعإِلِى َسبِيِلَرِّبَكبِاْلِحْكَمِةَواْلَمْوِعَظِةاْلَحَسَنِة:isastray,howwouldheshowwaytoothers”.AllahAlmightystates (surah al-nahl-125) He should be pious and ascetic that is to say, is safe from all major sins and if he commits any minor sin accidently, repents unto Allah immediately. He should have more concern for the hereafter than this world, it does not mean that he does not do worldly chores, rather, in the permitted way performs as many worldly tasks as required but does not neglect the hereafter because of being engaged in them, should perform virtuous deeds with eagerness and his heart should always be bent towards Allah Almighty despite being involved in any worldly task, should have kept company with any perfect Sheikh with due respect and affection and acquired the inner light from him, this is necessary because since old this fact has been there that one can set himself on the right path only after seeing a virtuous person, it is just in the same way as knowledge can be gained by sitting in the company of a scholar. He should keep no desire or greed for the wealth of his mureeds, an alternative for disciple, and should not desire others to praise or value him, should be aware of his disciples’ capabilities and train them just according to their aptitude. If any disciple of a deficient Peer comes to him, he should diagnose his illness just like a proficient doctor and then give the appropriate remedy. After understanding the moral flaws, should reform the person by instruction. It is necessary because the flawed Peer himself did not walk the Sulook (Way, Path) completely and did not reach the rank of passion, his company is poison for life and turning to him is a fatal illness. The company of such a Peer dissipates the capabilities of a talented disciple. Only a perfect Sheikh can help complete the steps of the Path. Thus learning spirituality from a flawed Peer is not allowed neither is it allowed to learn from the one whose ancestors were perfect Auliya (Friends of Allah) but he did not walk on their way, thus he does not possess that capability."

                  <h3>The Virtues of Silsila Aalia Naqshbandia</h3>
                <p>{isOpen?
                 "All groups of the Ahle Sunnah wal Jamaat are right. The leaders of Qadria, Chishtia, Suherwardia and other groups are praiseworthy and valuable. However, in comparison to other spiritual pedigrees of Sufiya-e-Karam, the Naqshbandia"
                 : "series has precedence due to many reasons. First: There is Qalbi dhikr (remembrance of Allah at heart) at the beginning of this Silsila (series or linkage) which includes Jazb (attraction by the Lord). Rather in the verbal dhikr, there is the Sulook (Path). Attraction and Path are two separate things: in the Path, a person tries to reach the Lord by remembrance, striving and hard work, whereas in Attraction, which is created due to Qalbi dhikr, Allah Almighty pulls the man towards Himself. Maulana Abdur Rahman Jami Naqshbandi (RA) states: The elders of Naqshband are leaders of strange caravan that they take their associates in the court of the Almighty in a hidden way. The appeal of their company drives away the thought of isolation and seclusion from the heart of the traveler. Second: The reason for the preference of Silsila Naqshbandia is that it directs focus on the following of the Prophet PBUH. The rise and progress of this group is entirely dependent on the obedience to the Prophet PBUH and according to the Quran, the only means for gaining Allah’s love is following the قُلإنُكنُتمُتِحُّبوَن ّ􏰀َفاَّتبُعونِيُيْحبْبُكم ّ􏰀.Sunnah of the Prophet PBUH “Say: If you love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you.”(Surah-Aal-e-imran-31)Third: Another reason of Silsila Naqshbandia being closest to the path i.e. the gain of Allah’s recognition is that in this linkage the intermediary for reaching the Prophet PBUH is Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddique RA who is the best of creation after the prophets. It is obvious that the stronger the medium the quicker will be the progress on the path. Forth: Where the other linkages have their end, there is the beginning of this group. Thus, this way is the best to gain Allah’s cognition. Hazrat Mujaddid Munawar Alf Sani RA states that: The Mashaikh of Silsila Naqshbandia started their inner excursion with the world of command and the world of creation is travelled within this. It is different from other groups in the way that they begin with the world of creation and only after that are they able to step into the world of command and then the place with attraction of the Lord or Maqaam-e-Jazba. Therefore, the Silsila Naqshbandia is the closest to the right way and others’ end is its beginning for sure. On the same subject, Hazrat Khawaja Ahmed Saeed Farooqui writes: In this period of time, making an attachment with Allah Almighty has become a rare thing. Therefore, the elders of Naqshband first teach the dhikr-e-Qalbi i.e. the remembrance at heart to the learner and instead of hard worship and striving they insist on prayers and order moderation in all cases. The preferences of the people of Naqshbandia linkage are much better and higher than the hard committed preferences of other linkages. They teach the learners to follow the Prophet (SAW) and avoid innovations and never suggest a dismissal for them from the tasks as far as possible. Thus these elders adopted the way of dhikr-e-Khafi (hidden remembrance)."

For the promotion of Tareeqa-e-sufiya, it is necessary to follow the commandments of Hazrat Muhammad PBUH in every manner, inside or outside with persistence and never cross the boundaries of Shariah. Always remain engaged in Allah’s remembrance and divine contemplation. Talk less, sleep less and eat less. The qualities of repentance, non-inclination towards the world, patience, contentment, trust on Allah, gratitude, the fear of Allah and acceptance should be present. Do not give importance to miracles and manifestations like ordinary people. Do not keep expectations from yourself and the creation. Do not be greedy for the wealth of the disciple. Do not care for respect by people or their refusal. Avoid the world and its seekers; serve the scholars and the indigent. Abstain from backbiting and condemnation of the creation of Allah Almighty.

                <p>{isOpen?
                 "In the path of mysticism, the pledge also called Bai’at has the prime importance. Without this the gain of absolute advantage is impossible and it is also proved from the Quran and the hadith. It is stated in the Quran: ِاَّنالَِّذۡيَنُيَبايُعۡوَنکَ ِاَّنَماُيَبايُعۡوَن ّٰ􏰀"
                 : "Surely those who swear allegiance to you do but swear allegiance to Allah (Surah fatah-10) The verbal meaning of Bai’at is to handover, entrust or to sell. In mysticism, the handing over and selling of the self by the disciple to the sheikh is called Bai’at. Meaning that omitting all his choices, powers and desires he should hand himself over to the perfect sheikh and never take any step in the path of spirituality without his approval. If any of his commandments are unknown to the disciple he should take it as his own lack of knowledge and consider them just similar to the acts and commandments of Khizr (AS); living in the hands of his sheikh as a dead body does in the hands of someone alive. This thing is called the pledge of travelers (Bai’at-e-Salikeen). This is the objective of the Mashaikh and this is the way leading to the Lord Allah Almighty SWT. This is the pledge taken by the Prophet (SAW) from his companions (RA).Hazrat Ibada bin Saamit (RA) narrates that they made a vow with the Prophet PBUH that in every ease or hardship, pleasant or unpleasant, they shall accept every order issued, obey it with absolute detail and never say a word after listening to it.The order of the perfect guide is also, in fact, the order of the Prophet PBUH because the perfect Wali is the deputy of the Prophet PBUH. The perfect guide (Sheikh-e-Kamil) is basically defined as the one who obeys the Prophet PBUH in most perfect a manner. Therefore, no order of his shall be against the Prophet’s PBUH teachings. Hence, the order of the perfect guide is proved to be the order of the Prophet PBUH, the order of the Prophet PBUH in turn is that of Allah Almighty and no one is allowed to say a ‘No’ after Allah’s order."

                 "The scholars and knowledgeable men of the Path contradict in whether the Pledge is Farz (obligatory),Wajib (of a little less importance than the obligatory), Sunnah or Mustahab (appreciated). Those who َيا أَ ُّي َھا الَّ ِذي َن آ َم ُنواْ ا َّتقُو ْا ّ􏰀 َوا ْب َت ُغو ْا إلَي ِه ا ْل َو ِسيلَ َة َو َجا ِھ ُدو ْا فِي َسبيلِ ِه :consider it obligatory, present this verse as a proofل َ َع ل َّ ُك ْم ُت ْف ل ِ ُح و َن"
                 : "“O you who believe! Be careful of (your duty to) Allah and seek means of nearness to Him and strive hard in His way that you may be successful”(Surah َوا َّتبِ ْع َسبِيلَ َم ْن أَ َنا َب إِلَ ّي ,And in the other verse it is said“And follow the way of him who turns to Me”(Surah Luqman-15)As in both the verses, the form of order is used; therefore the pledge has been taken as obligatory. Along with that when the pledge is a door to the knowledge of Ehsaan (goodness), so there can be no doubt in it being an obligation because it is the soul of all prayers and worshipping.According to those commentators who consider the pledge to be Wajib think that the form of order makes it Wajib and if it had been obligatory, those who deny it will be the non-believers. Although it is certain that those who do not believe in it are not the non-believers.Many scholars think that the form of order implies that it is Mustahab. As a proof, they say that the pledge had been Farz or Wajib, there had been any warning from the law-giver for quitting it and its forsaker would have been said to be a non-believer. But there has been no such order in the Shari’ah and the Tariqat is obedient to the Shari’ah. َِِ"

They also gave the women this honor behind the veil. This proves that the pledge is a Sunnah and it is ordered."

Thus the pledge is meant for the inner success with the purpose of clearing away the impurities of the inside and enlightening it along with the eradication of the hidden shirk (shirk-e-khafi). Thus, whenever a disciple vows on the hand of the sheikh with the right intentions and sincerity and brings into practice all the etiquettes, then with the inner glance of the perfect mentor the spiritual blessings permeate into the heart and soul of the disciple, illuminating his inside. The gain of these spiritual and inner blessings and enlightenment is dependent on the affection and company of the mentor. It is possible only if the disciple directs his heart and soul fully towards the perfect sheikh at the time of attendance so that with the proportion of sheikh’s pure nature and inner duties, the spiritual coordination of the disciple strengthens and making progress he gains Allah’s closeness. But the traveler should always remember that all stages are dependent on the company and love of the perfect mentor."

                 : "importance and status of the company of the mentor so that the required advantages are gained in the appropriate manner. When the seeker is in the presence of the sheikh he should focus his heart and soul towards the sheikh because the mentor provides benefit to the disciple with his attention. If the disciple is not focused towards the guide, some other enthusiastic and directed disciple may get his share too because the indifference of the disciple disinclines the sheikh from him and the perfect sheikh blesses the directed disciple with his attention. Therefore, indifference in the company of the mentor means depriving one’s own self.Mujaddid Alf Sani (RA), while talking about benefitting from the company of the mentor, writes to Hakim Abdul Wahab that one should come to the Auliya empty-handed so as to go back full and show one’s insolvency so that they may have pity and the door gets opened for the disciple to gain advantage. Coming full and going back full gives no joy because the fruit of satiation is nothing but illness. Indifference and carelessness brings about nothing but insubordination.This letter of Imam Mujaddid Alf Sani (RA) shows that in the company of the sheikh one should pay maximum heed to one’s heart and the inside and strive for its purification and betterment. Do not go keeping eye on other seekers, learners and the ones making dhikr. Besides this one should abstain from those acts in the hospice or company of the sheikh which may hurt others. One must never talk useless because most of the time such things might cause the mentor to be angry which is harmful for the progress of the disciple. The disciple should know that sitting in a far-off place and only telling the mentor on phone or through letters about his circumstances and situations might not be very beneficial rather attendance in the sheikh’s company is also necessary. Without the company of the sheikh many advantages cannot be gained. Without this company the disciple may recite hundreds of thousands of invocations and religious brooding but will gain nothing because it is the way of Allah Almighty that He does not grant any benefit without a source or an intermediary. Therefore it is necessary for the disciple to consider essential the attendance in his company and abundance at that. Hazrat Khawaja Gharib Nawaz Pir Mitha Rehmatpuri (RA) states in his letters that one should visit his sheikh so often that he starts thinking his mentor’s home to be his own home and the mentor’s country to be his own country. But this should be kept in mind as well that the Auliya have kept the love for sheikh the first condition for the company of the sheikh. Hazrat Abdul Haq Muhaddis of Delhi states in his letters that if without love and affection the company and relation is maintained for years it will be of no benefit. Therefore it is necessary for the disciple to attend the company of the sheikh with immense love, attention and focus for his own benefit. Only in this manner will the disciple be able to deserve the glance which will be a source of blessings for him through his entire life. Thus, being enthusiastic one should make justice to this affection to become blessed."

                  <h3>The Method of Making Dhikr (Remembrance)</h3>

                 "The method for making dhikr is that, in one’s heart, which is present at the left side of the chest, one should remember and recite the name of Allah. It is just in the same way as "
                 : "when we are thirsty we think about water. We do not call the word with our tongue but keep thinking about water. Thus, just like a thirsty person thinks about water, one should plant this thought in one’s mind that his heart is calling ‘Allah’. The tongue should remain quiet, or better yet it should stick to the roof of mouth inside and the thought of this dhikr should always be kept in mind. It does not have any of the conditions like ablution or the purity of the body or clothes or even loneliness. Keep doing your work round the clock, doing business, travelling or not, in market or at home, just keep in mind that your heart is calling ‘Allah’. If during this any other thought comes to mind, drive it away because Allah Almighty has said ِرَجالٌَّلاُتْلِھيِھْمتَِجاَرةٌَوَلاَبْيٌع َعنِذْكِر َّ􏰀ِ:that “Men whom neither merchandise nor selling diverts from the remembrance of Allah”(surah al-noor 37) Keeping this thought in mind for a few days, the heart sets on its flow in dhikr and it is purified with the dhikr creating a sense of fear from Allah and making easy the following of the Sunnah. Hazrat Khawaja Ahmad Saeed Naqshbandi writes that the dhikr or remembrance of the great name should be made in such a way that the seeker should stick the tongue to its roof and empty the mind of all thoughts. The mentor, from whom he had taken the lesson, should be brought to mind thinking as if he were sitting right in front. Then say the name of Allah with the tongue of the heart that is to say keep in mind the meaning of the word Allah and remember that he has believed in the One who possesses all these perfect qualities and is devoid of all flawed qualities. He should be persistent on this remembrance unless the heart becomes a remembering one. Hazrat Mujaddad Alf Sani (RA) states: In the beginning of the Path, there is no way for the traveler other than the dhikr. It is required that he should pay attention to his heart as this piece of flesh is like a room to the real soul. Let this blessed word ‘Allah’ run through the heart. Do not move any other body part intentionally rather all attention should be directed towards the heart instead of its appearance. Think about the word Allah as matchless and incomparable but do not bring any other quality to the mind along with this. (Letter No. 190, Version 1, Part 3)"

                  <h3>The Remembrance at Heart (Dhikr-e-Qalbi)</h3>

                 "The importance and virtues of Allah’s dhikr be it in the heart or verbally, individually or collectively are proved. But with the study of the Quran and the Hadith we come to know that the virtues of "
                 : "dhikr at heart are by degrees much more than the verbal dhikr. However, if Allah Almighty wants to be gracious to someone and destines him to be the most fortunate person, he allows him to keep making the verbal remembrance and along with that his heart also accompanies the tongue, this verbal dhikr escalates him as high as the the progress in the Qalbi dhikr (remembrance at heart). If the tongue is kept quiet but the heart keeps on making dhikr, it is called the Abundant Dhikr or Dhikr-e-Kathir. In virtue of dhikr, an internationally famous Muhaddis and researcher Hazrat Mulla Ali Qari has narrated a hadith from Abu Darda (RA): عن أبي الدرداءرضي 􏰀 عنه قال رسول 􏰀 صلى 􏰀 عليه وسلم ألا أنبئكم بخير أعمالكم وأزكاھا عند مليككم وأرفعھا في درجاتكم وخير لكم من إنفاق الذھب والورق وخيرلكم من أن تلقوا عدوكم فتضربوا أعناقھم ويضربوا أعناقكم قالوا بلى قال ذكر 􏰀 Rasulullah Sallallahu alaihe wasallam once said to his companions, “Shall I tell you of something that is the best of all deeds, constitutes the best act of piety in the eyes of Lord, will elevate your status in the Hereafter, and carries more virtue than the spending of gold and silver in the service of Allah or taking part in jihad and slaying or being slain in the path of Allah.” The companions begged to be informed of such an act. The Prophet PBUH replied, “It is the dhikr of Almighty Allah”. Hazrat Mulla Ali Qari explains this hadith as follows: The dhikr here refers to the dhikr-e-qalbi. This one is he dhikr whose rank is higher than sacrificing one’s life and wealth because this is an act of inside and the act of heart which is tougher for the self than the deeds of other body parts. Rather this is the biggest struggle (Jihaad-e-Akbar). (Mirqaat-ul-Mafateeh, page 22, Version 3)"
